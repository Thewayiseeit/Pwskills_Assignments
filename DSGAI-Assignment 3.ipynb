    "Q - Explain the significance of Python keywords and provide examples of five keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes in the Python programming language. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names or function names) because they are predefined and have specific functionalities within the language. Understanding and using Python keywords correctly is essential for writing valid and efficient Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the significances of Python keywords:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax and Structure: Keywords define the syntax and structure of the Python language. They specify the operations, control flow, and data types supported by Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reserved Functionality: Keywords have predefined functionalities assigned by the Python interpreter. Attempting to redefine or override these functionalities can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Readability: Keywords enhance the readability of Python code by providing clear and concise ways to express programming constructs and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - if, for, def, return, import etc.\n",

    "Q - Describe the rules for defining identifiers in Python and provide an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, identifiers are names given to entities like variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. Identifiers are used to uniquely identify these entities in the code. Here are the rules for defining identifiers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Valid Characters: Identifiers can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores (_). They must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, so myVariable, MyVariable, and MYVARIABLE are considered different identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reserved Keywords: Identifiers cannot be the same as Python keywords or reserved words. For example, you cannot use if, else, for, while, def, class, etc., as identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Length: There is no limit on the length of identifiers in Python, but it's a good practice to keep them concise and descriptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Special Characters: Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, etc., are not allowed in identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example - my_variable = 10"

    "Q - What are comments in Python, and why are they useful? Provide an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, comments are textual annotations within the code that are ignored by the Python interpreter during execution. They are used to add explanatory notes, documentation, or to temporarily disable certain lines of code without affecting the program's functionality. Comments are an essential aspect of programming as they improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some reasons why comments are useful in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explanation and Documentation: Comments provide additional information about the purpose, logic, or functionality of the code. They help other developers (including your future self) understand the code more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Debugging and Troubleshooting: Comments can be used to temporarily disable certain lines of code for debugging purposes. They help in isolating specific sections of code to identify and fix errors more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Maintenance: Comments serve as reminders for future modifications or enhancements to the codebase. They help in documenting changes, improvements, or workarounds applied to the code over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example = # This is a single-line comment\n"

    "Q - Why is proper indentation important in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Proper indentation is crucial in Python because it defines the structure and scope of the code. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces {} or keywords like begin and end to denote code blocks, Python uses indentation to indicate the beginning and end of blocks of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why proper indentation is important in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Readability: Proper indentation enhances code readability by visually organizing the code into logical blocks. It makes it easier for developers to understand the flow and structure of the code at a glance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Code Clarity: Indentation makes the code clearer and more understandable by visually representing the hierarchical structure of the code. It helps in identifying nested code blocks, such as loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Syntax Requirement: In Python, indentation is not just a style convention; it is a syntax requirement. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or logical errors in the code.\n"

    "Q - What happens if indentation is incorrect in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "If indentation is incorrect in Python, it can lead to various issues, including syntax errors, logical errors, or unintended behavior in the code. Here are some consequences of incorrect indentation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax Errors: Incorrect indentation violates Python's syntax rules and can result in syntax errors. Python expects proper indentation to define the structure and scope of code blocks such as loops, conditional statements, and function definitions. Missing or inconsistent indentation can cause Python to raise syntax errors and fail to parse the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Misinterpretation of Code: Incorrect indentation can lead to misinterpretation of the code's logic and structure. Python relies on indentation to determine the hierarchy and nesting of code blocks. Improper indentation can cause statements to be interpreted incorrectly, leading to unintended behavior or logical errors in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unexpected Behavior: Incorrect indentation can cause the code to behave unexpectedly or produce incorrect results. For example, if statements, loops, or function definitions with incorrect indentation may execute differently than intended or may not execute at all. This can result in bugs or errors that are difficult to diagnose and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ambiguity: Incorrect indentation can introduce ambiguity in the code, making it challenging to understand or maintain. Inconsistent or irregular indentation styles can confuse developers and make the codebase less readable and more error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Maintenance Challenges: Code with incorrect indentation is harder to maintain and modify. Developers may struggle to identify and correct indentation errors, leading to inefficiencies in code review, debugging, and collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Violation of Coding Standards: Incorrect indentation violates Python's coding standards and best practices. Consistent and proper indentation is essential for writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code. Violating indentation conventions can make the codebase difficult to manage and adhere to coding standards.\n",

    "Q - Differentiate 0etween expression and statement in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, expressions and statements are fundamental building blocks of code, but they have distinct roles and behaviors:\n",
    "\n",
    "@ Expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "Expressions can be simple (e.g., 5, x, 2 + 3) or complex (e.g., x * (y + z), math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)).\n",
    "Expressions can be used anywhere a value is expected, such as in assignments, function arguments, return statements, and within other expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "@ Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action or controls the flow of execution in a program.\n",
    "Statements include assignments, conditionals, loops, function definitions, import statements, etc.\n",
